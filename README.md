# Mining and Searching App Reviews for Requirements Engineering: Evaluation and Replication Studies

The repository shares a replication package for the study: J. Dąbrowski et al.,
"Mining and Searching App Reviews for Requirements Engineering: Evaluation and Replication Studies", [Update Once Paper Accepted], 2022.

## About

### Goal

The goal of the study was to evaluate and compare approaches for mining feature-related information from app reviews. The study performed two experiments; the first experiment evaluated tools for mining user opinions. The second experiment evaluated tools for finding feature-relatd app reviews. We here provide the replication package for the study and the description of how to run the experiments.
